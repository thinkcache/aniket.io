## Educated: A Memoir - Tara Westover

#### About the Book:

The book is a memoir of Tara Westover's childhood and her educational leap. Tara was born and raised in Idaho in a family that does not believe in formal education. This shaped a lot of her early childhood. She then went against her own family and enrolled for college at the age of 17, her first formal education. And then this educational journey continued through the halls of Cambridge and Harvard. She went a long way ahead. This book is about her sacrifices, the hard choices she made, and she achieved an understanding of herself.

This book is not just about her story. It opens up a perspective on how hard work and sacrifices, can open up doors for you. That you should aim for the stars, and with enough dedication you can reach there as well. These are those extra-ordinary journeys of self-realization and understanding the purpose of existence in this world.

## What I learned from the book:

#### Tough Decisions and Sacrifice:
Life is not always fair. You cannot change where you are born. However, to change where you are today, there are always tough decisions to be made. You have to leave things behind to go ahead. You will have to sacrifice somethings today, to go ahead in life.

#### Hard Work:
There is no substitute for hard work. No matter what your current situation is, tomorrow can always be better. And the only thing stopping you is your dedication and commitment to hard work.

#### Limitless possibilities:
You need to open up your mind to all the great things in this world. You never know what you might achieve. Success might just be right around the corner, but you still have to keep walking ahead towards that corner.

#### Embrace your past:
Everyone has a unique past. Past might be ugly and dull, but that is what shaped you to what you are today.
