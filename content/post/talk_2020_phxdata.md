I gave a presentation revolving around the book "The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution" at the Phoenix Data Conference 2020. The event was held virtually and recordings are available. 

I demonstrated a proof of concept code to explain basics of using Machine Learning in stock trading.
