I decided to read Michelle Obama’s memoir ‘Becoming’ before starting Barack Obama’s book 'A Promised Land'. This book describes the personal life journey of Michelle Obama, on how her out-of-the-way decisions in life led to rewarding experiences and thus becoming her identity. Michelle’s work before becoming FLOTUS revolves around community building and development in and around Chicago. She later continued the work with National level programs to improve education, health, and nutrition. The book is inspiring, for all readers.

We all know Barack Obama and his accomplishments but rarely do people recognize Michelle Obama’s work and sacrifices. She grew up in a modest family in Chicago, earning her way into the halls of Princeton and Harvard. Then taking a high-profile job as a lawyer in Chicago only to leave it later to work actively in community building work.

Some might recognize them as a power couple, and imagine them to have all the answers to a successful marriage. This is far away from reality. The power couple is not two great people coming together, but rather two minds coming together to create great synergy and cooperation, resulting in fulfilling and meaningful lives. Michelle was brave enough to admit that they needed counseling during their marriage, which in some communities is still considered taboo, and how it helped them become more responsible adults and parents to their young kids. She describes how Michelle and Barack sacrificed, inspired, and supported each other to achieve great things.

The book also provides details on the presidential journey, moving to Washington with 2 young kids in a fortified castle called the White House, and how it has an impact on their lives. It opens up the view of a mother who is trying to adjust in the big house, and struggling to provide their kids with a normal life rather than spoiling them with all luxuries afforded to them.
