After some 5-6 basic questions and then later typing something on the keyboard, the VISA interviewer asked which looked like the final question, “Do you have plans to return to India?” to which I instantly replied with an affirmative answer “Yes.” Then he seemed to start again typing a few things, and then he finally said something. I only remember the part where he said, “You can collect your passport later; you will get an SMS when it’s ready.” I was overjoyed at that very moment. Relaxed, I departed out of the US embassy in Mumbai.

I collected the passport a few days later with my US visa imprinted on a passport page.

### New beginnings await — a new journey about to commence.
