This class had some excellent sessions till now. We discussed on how analytics is changing the landscape of the businesses. We learned how companies are leveraging Analytics, and which opportunities are opening for students with such specialized skillset in Analytics.

This class has take-home quizzes, where we have to read HBR cases to prepare for the quiz. These cases cover a wide range of application of Analytics in the industry. Also in the final week, as a team, we have to prepare a pitch for an innovative idea which leverages Analytics.
